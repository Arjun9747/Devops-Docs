# Workspace

Terraform workspaces allow you to use the same Terraform configuration to manage multiple environments or copies of infrastructure, like dev, staging, and prod.

Each workspace has its own state file (terraform.tfstate), so changes made in one workspace donâ€™t affect the others.

terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new prod

terraform workspace list

terraform workspace select dev

# Pass as variable

variable "env" {
  type    = string
  default = terraform.workspace
}
