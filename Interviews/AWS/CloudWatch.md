Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service by AWS that collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events for AWS resources, applications, and custom workloads. It enables you to monitor system performance, detect anomalies, set alarms, and automate responses.

It works by:

Collecting data from AWS services (like EC2, Lambda, RDS)

Accepting custom metrics and logs from applications or on-premise servers

Triggering alarms based on metric thresholds

Visualizing data through dashboards

Enabling event-driven automation using EventBridge or CloudWatch Alarms

üîÅ Follow-up: What types of data does CloudWatch collect?
Answer:
CloudWatch collects three main types of observability data:


üîπ Optional: Traces & Alarms
CloudWatch also integrates with:

X-Ray traces (for distributed tracing)

CloudWatch Alarms (monitor thresholds and trigger notifications or actions)

**Custom Metric**

```markdown
To set up a custom metric in Amazon CloudWatch, you publish your own numeric data points (e.g., queue size, request count, cache hits) using the PutMetricData API. This allows you to monitor application-specific or business-level KPIs not captured by AWS by default.

| Type                 | Granularity | Use Case                                  | Cost        |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Standard Metrics** | 1-minute    | General monitoring, dashboards, alarms    | Lower cost  |
| **High-Resolution**  | 1-second    | Real-time monitoring, low-latency systems | Higher cost |

üß† When to Use High-Resolution Metrics:
Use high-resolution (1s) if:

You're monitoring real-time systems (e.g., gaming, trading)

You want fast alarm reaction times (e.g., failover, autoscaling)

You‚Äôre tracking short-lived spikes (e.g., bursty traffic)
```
********************************************************************************************************************

**Alarms**

```markdown
A CloudWatch Alarm is a monitoring feature in AWS CloudWatch that watches a single metric (or math expression of metrics) and performs actions based on thresholds you define. It continuously evaluates metric values and changes state when they cross thresholds, allowing for alerting, automation, or scaling actions

üìå Alarm States
OK ‚Äì Metric is within defined limits
ALARM ‚Äì Metric has crossed the threshold (e.g., high CPU, low free memory)
INSUFFICIENT_DATA ‚Äì Not enough data to evaluate the threshold

‚úÖ Follow-up 1: What happens when an alarm transitions from OK to ALARM?
Answer:
When the alarm transitions from OK to ALARM, CloudWatch:
Executes any configured actions:
Sends an SNS notification
Triggers a Lambda function or Auto Scaling policy
Logs the state change in CloudWatch Events
(Optional) Creates an entry in AWS Health Dashboard or incident tracking tools (via integration)
‚úÖ Best practice: always test the action with simulated state changes.

Yes, you can create composite alarms in CloudWatch. These alarms evaluate the state of multiple other alarms using logical expressions (AND, OR, NOT) instead of watching a single metric.

| Scenario                               | Why Composite Alarm Helps                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Avoiding noise                         | Only alert when **multiple metrics fail** (e.g., latency **AND** error rate) |
| Creating critical alerts               | Alert only when **all regional alarms** are in `ALARM`                       |
| Combining infrastructure + app signals | Trigger alarm if **CPU is high AND API is slow**                             |
| Suppress flapping alerts               | Alert only on **sustained multiple alarm states**                            |

A metric filter analyzes log data in near real-time and creates a CloudWatch metric from specific patterns found in the logs.

‚ÄúWe had noisy alerts every Monday morning due to predictable CPU spikes when batch jobs ran. By switching to anomaly detection, CloudWatch learned this pattern and only alerted us when something abnormal happened ‚Äî like jobs running longer than usual.‚Äù

```

**Cloud Trail Management and Data Events**

```markdown
üîπ Management Events (Control Plane)
‚ÄúThese capture control plane operations ‚Äî in other words, who is managing or configuring AWS resources. This includes actions like creating an EC2 instance, modifying IAM policies, or deleting an S3 bucket.
These are enabled by default in CloudTrail and are usually lower in volume.‚Äù

Examples:
RunInstances (launch EC2)
CreateUser, AttachPolicy
CreateBucket, UpdateFunctionConfiguration

üîπ Data Events (Data Plane)
‚ÄúThese log interactions with the content or data stored in services like S3, Lambda, or DynamoDB.
They are more granular and high-volume, which is why they‚Äôre not enabled by default and have a separate cost.‚Äù

Examples:
GetObject, PutObject on S3
Invoke a Lambda function
GetItem on DynamoDB (via CloudTrail Lake)

‚ÄúThis distinction helps balance audit completeness vs cost. Management events give a high-level view of system changes, while Data Events are used for forensics, compliance audits, and detecting unauthorized data access.‚Äù

To secure CloudTrail logs, I encrypt them with KMS, restrict access using fine-grained S3 bucket policies, and enable integrity validation to detect tampering. I also centralize logs in a secure audit account and monitor for unauthorized access or configuration changes ‚Äî all of which are key for forensic readiness and compliance

‚ÄúTo ensure CloudTrail logs are immutable, I enable S3 Object Lock in compliance mode, restrict all PutObject and DeleteObject permissions with bucket policies, and use CloudTrail‚Äôs log file integrity validation. I also centralize logs in a dedicated log archive account and monitor for any changes to CloudTrail or its destination bucket to ensure full audit integrity.‚Äù

Yes, CloudTrail is a critical tool for auditing AWS activity, but it does have some limitations and potential logging gaps.

üîπ First, CloudTrail is not real-time ‚Äî there's typically a 5‚Äì15 minute delay for management events and longer for data events. So I don't rely on it for immediate threat detection.

üîπ Second, it only captures control plane activity by default. If I want to monitor data-level access (like S3 GetObject), I must explicitly enable data events, which can increase costs.

üîπ Third, unless I enable multi-region trails or use an organization-wide trail, I might miss events from other regions or accounts.

To address this, I always:
Enable multi-region and org-wide trails
Enable data events for critical S3 buckets and Lambda functions
Use EventBridge rules to detect critical activity like DeleteTrail or ConsoleLogin failures
Forward CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs or a SIEM for faster processing and alerting
Monitor delivery health and integrity using digest files and log validation
