| **Phase**                | **Purpose**                                                               | **How the Calculator Helps**                                           |

| **Assessment** ✅         | Understand current infrastructure and estimate future AWS costs           | Estimate costs for lift-and-shift, modernization, or hybrid strategies |
| **Planning** ✅           | Design target architecture, choose services, evaluate cost vs performance | Compare pricing models (e.g., On-Demand vs Reserved Instances)         |
| **Optimization** (Later) | Optimize running workloads                                                | Simulate savings with Reserved Instances or Savings Plans              |
