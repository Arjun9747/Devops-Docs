*Facts*

Pieces of information collected by ansible 

```yaml
---
- name: Gather facts and display system information
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: yes

  tasks:
  - name: Display system information
    debug:
      msg: |
        OS: {{ ansible_distribution }} {{ ansible_distribution_version }}
        IP Address: {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}
        Memory: {{ ansible_memtotal_mb }} MB
```

*Register*

Register keyword is used to capture the output of a task (such as command output, status code, etc.) and store it in a variable.

```yaml
---
- name: Register output of a task
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Run a command and register output
    shell: "uptime"
    register: uptime_output

  - name: Display registered output
    debug:
      msg: "Uptime output: {{ uptime_output.stdout }}"
```

*Ansible Galaxy*

Ansible Galaxy is a repository of pre-built Ansible roles that can be easily installed and used in your playbooks. 

*Handlers*

Handlers are special tasks in Ansible that run only when notified by other tasks. They are typically used for actions that 

should happen only if something changed, such as:

Restarting a service

Reloading a configuration

Rebooting a system

*Notify*

Notify is a directive used in a task to trigger a handler when that task makes a change.

```yaml
---
- name: Configure NGINX and handle changes
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes

  tasks:

    - name: Copy NGINX configuration file
      copy:
        src: files/nginx.conf        # Source file in your Ansible project
        dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf  # Destination on target host
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: '0644'
      notify: Restart NGINX

    - name: Ensure NGINX is running
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes

  handlers:

    - name: Restart NGINX
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
```

*Dynamic Inventory*

In Ansible, an inventory is a list of hosts (systems) you manage.

By default, Ansible uses a static inventory file (hosts), but this can become limiting when your infrastructure is dynamic â€” such as in cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) where instances may start/stop/change frequently.

ðŸ‘‰ Dynamic inventory solves this by generating the list of hosts programmatically at runtime, often from an API or script.

```yaml
# File: aws_ec2.yml

plugin: aws_ec2
regions:
  - us-east-1
  - us-west-2
filters:
  tag:Environment: dev
hostnames:
  - private-ip-address
compose:
  ansible_host: private_ip_address
```
The aws_ec2 plugin is used to generate the dynamic inventory.

The regions section specifies the AWS regions to query for EC2 instances.

The filters section specifies a filter to only include instances with the Environment tag set to dev.

**jinja files*

Generate config files (nginx.conf, sshd_config, httpd.conf, etc.)

Create scripts dynamically (e.g., startup.sh, install.sh)

Template cloud init or Terraform variables

Customize email templates, Slack messages, or alerts
