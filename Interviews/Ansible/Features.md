*Facts*

Pieces of information collected by ansible 

```yaml
---
- name: Gather facts and display system information
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: yes

  tasks:
  - name: Display system information
    debug:
      msg: |
        OS: {{ ansible_distribution }} {{ ansible_distribution_version }}
        IP Address: {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}
        Memory: {{ ansible_memtotal_mb }} MB
```

*Register*

Register keyword is used to capture the output of a task (such as command output, status code, etc.) and store it in a variable.

```yaml
---
- name: Register output of a task
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Run a command and register output
    shell: "uptime"
    register: uptime_output

  - name: Display registered output
    debug:
      msg: "Uptime output: {{ uptime_output.stdout }}"
```

*Ansible Galaxy*

Ansible Galaxy is a repository of pre-built Ansible roles that can be easily installed and used in your playbooks. 

*Handlers*

Handlers are special tasks in Ansible that run only when notified by other tasks. They are typically used for actions that 

should happen only if something changed, such as:

Restarting a service

Reloading a configuration

Rebooting a system

*Notify*

Notify is a directive used in a task to trigger a handler when that task makes a change.

```yaml
---
- name: Configure NGINX and handle changes
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes

  tasks:

    - name: Copy NGINX configuration file
      copy:
        src: files/nginx.conf        # Source file in your Ansible project
        dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf  # Destination on target host
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: '0644'
      notify: Restart NGINX

    - name: Ensure NGINX is running
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes

  handlers:

    - name: Restart NGINX
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
```

*Dynamic Inventory*

In Ansible, an inventory is a list of hosts (systems) you manage.

By default, Ansible uses a static inventory file (hosts), but this can become limiting when your infrastructure is dynamic â€” such as in cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) where instances may start/stop/change frequently.

ðŸ‘‰ Dynamic inventory solves this by generating the list of hosts programmatically at runtime, often from an API or script.

```yaml
# File: aws_ec2.yml

plugin: aws_ec2
regions:
  - us-east-1
  - us-west-2
filters:
  tag:Environment: dev
hostnames:
  - private-ip-address
compose:
  ansible_host: private_ip_address
```
The aws_ec2 plugin is used to generate the dynamic inventory.

The regions section specifies the AWS regions to query for EC2 instances.

The filters section specifies a filter to only include instances with the Environment tag set to dev.

*jinja files*

Generate config files (nginx.conf, sshd_config, httpd.conf, etc.)

Create scripts dynamically (e.g., startup.sh, install.sh)

Template cloud init or Terraform variables

Customize email templates, Slack messages, or alerts

*Structure*

name

host

become

vars 

roles 

The lineinfile module is used to ensure a specific line is present, absent, or replaced in a text file on a target machine.

```yaml
- name: Ensure a line is present in a file
  ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
    path: /etc/myconfig.conf
    line: 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH'
```

*Grouping Host*

Grouping hosts in Ansible means organizing your inventory into groups based on criteria like environment, role, location, OS, etc

| Optimization Technique   | Benefit                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Loops                    | Reduce repetition, concise code    |
| Native modules           | Idempotent and optimized           |
| Handlers                 | Avoid unnecessary service restarts |
| Fact caching             | Speed up repeated runs             |
| Delegation & Async       | Efficient task distribution        |
| Play-level `become`      | Cleaner, less repetition           |
| Selective fact gathering | Faster playbook start              |
| Tags                     | Run partial playbooks              |
| Roles                    | Modular, reusable code             |

*Delegate*

Sometimes a task must be run on a specific control node or jump host instead of the target host. For example, copying 

files from one host to another, or running a command on the control machine while managing remote hosts.

Use fallback nodes or run recovery steps elsewhere

*Async*

Run tasks asynchronously, allowing the playbook to continue without waiting for the task to finish.

async: maximum time (in seconds) allowed for the task to run

poll: 0: fire and forget (donâ€™t wait for the result)

*Selective Fact Gathering*

Gathering facts can be slow, especially on many hosts or when you donâ€™t need all facts. Selective gathering or disabling it speeds up playbook execution

| Feature                      | Purpose                                         | Example Use Case                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Delegation**               | Run task on different host (e.g., control node) | Copy files from remote to local           |
| **Async**                    | Run long tasks without blocking playbook        | Run backup or build jobs in background    |
| **Selective Fact Gathering** | Speed up execution by limiting gathered facts   | Skip gathering or gather only needed info |

*Serial*

The serial keyword lets you run the playbook tasks on a limited number of hosts at a time (batch size) instead of all hosts simultaneously.

Useful for rolling updates or staggered deployments to reduce risk.

serial: 1 â€” Run on one host at a time, moving to the next only after success.

serial: 5 â€” Run on 5 hosts in parallel batches.

serial: 50% â€” Run on half of the hosts in each batch.

Fact Caching stores these gathered facts locally or remotely, so subsequent playbook runs can reuse the facts without gathering them again, speeding up execution.

Ansible is agentless, meaning it doesn't require any agent (like Puppet or Chef) to be installed on the managed nodes.

*Error Handling*

ignore-error: yes --> Allows a task to continue even if it fails.

failed_when -->  Override failure condition (return failure even if Ansible thinks it's a successâ€”or vice versa).

block, rescue, and always  --> Structure to handle try-catch-finally logic.

ansible.builtin.assert --> - disk_space.stdout | int > 1024

*Facts*

In Ansible, facts are pieces of information automatically discovered about your managed nodes (hosts). These include system properties like:

OS type, IP addresses, hostname

Memory, CPU count

Network interfaces

Mount points

and many moreâ€¦

These facts are gathered automatically by default using the setup module.

```yaml
- name: Example using Ansible facts
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Print the OS type
      debug:
        msg: "This machine is running {{ ansible_distribution }} {{ ansible_distribution_version }}"

    - name: Print IP address
      debug:
        msg: "Primary IP address is {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}"
```
| Fact                           | Description          |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `ansible_os_family`            | RedHat, Debian, etc. |
| `ansible_distribution`         | Ubuntu, CentOS, etc. |
| `ansible_hostname`             | Hostname             |
| `ansible_all_ipv4_addresses`   | All IPv4 addresses   |
| `ansible_processor_cores`      | Number of cores      |
| `ansible_memory_mb.real.total` | Total memory in MB   |
