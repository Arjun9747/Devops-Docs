 | Metric                             | What it Measures                        | Why it Matters                      |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **1. Deployment Frequency (DF)**   | How often you deploy to production      | Measures speed of delivery          |
| **2. Lead Time for Changes (LT)**  | Time from code commit to deploy         | Measures development efficiency     |
| **3. Change Failure Rate (CFR)**   | % of deployments that cause failures    | Measures quality and stability      |
| **4. Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)** | Time to recover from production failure | Measures reliability and resilience |
